# Getting Started

  The first step involves filling up our Spaces Game Onboard Google Sheet. It asks for basic details about the game and most importantly the assets for which you want integrate the Spaces Ad Engine in your game.

  Fill [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIFysDzRIVkc9gkF101HJG3zOa4xh1mzM5jihQzdcv0/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet following the instructions mentioned in it.

  Upload your Game Reference Assets [Here](https://forms.gle/JFr45Np13aYzwJwz6)

### Step Demo
You can check out the Onboard Demo [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XJ35uNioYIG1OY2wtQm0fTT8shOE6zUO/view?usp=sharing).


Once we have the details, we will generate and send you a Spaces Unity Package in a few hours, using which you can proceed with integration.
